# netlify backup

one day i accidentally nuked all my repos (cause im clunky). and some of the stuff i've done over the years was deployed to vercel and netlify. fortunately i was able to download deploys from netlify so i'll keep it here. vercel on the other hand does not offer this feature (such a shame)
